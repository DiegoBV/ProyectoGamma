I make dark/ritual/ambient/atmospheric sound pieces, mostly for my own entertainment (and yours if you like that kind of thing - 
free downloads at the soundcloud link above). I dont really know a lot about music or the tech involved but it's just for fun, so why
not. I've used a few samples from freesound.org in my own pieces and it's such a great resource for people like me who maybe don't
have the equipment or the know-how to create the specific sounds we want, so I figured I'd upload the ones I've made myself so other
people can use them. Anything I upload here will be under Creative Commons 0 so you can use it any way you want.
